# Splitcells Network Media
This repo contains media files of the Splitcells Network.

This was moved to a dedicated repo,
because such media files may require much storage.
It is easier to move this dedicated repo into an existing repo,
then the other way around.
So, in order to avoid such a situation a dedicated repo was created.
